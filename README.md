## Network Traffic Analysis Tool
This repository contains a Python-based tool for analyzing network traffic captured in .pcap or similar formats. The script processes packet data and provides insights into source and destination IPs, protocols, ports, and other details, helping users understand network activity and identify anomalies.

## Features

## 1-Packet Analysis:
Extracts detailed information on each packet, including:
Source IP and Destination IP
Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
Source and Destination Ports (if applicable)
Identifies protocols and maps protocol numbers to human-readable names.

## 2-Traffic Insights:
Differentiates between local (127.0.0.1) and external network traffic.
Analyzes ICMP traffic, such as ping requests, and TCP communications.

## Observations:
Highlights traffic patterns, missing ports, and unusual configurations.
Explains scenarios like virtual network interfaces without ports.

## Use Cases
Learning about networking fundamentals, such as protocols and packet structures.
Debugging network issues or testing virtual machine (VM) configurations.
Observing local communication between applications via the loopback address.

## Requirements
Python 3.x
Scapy library

## How to Use
Capture network traffic using a tool like Wireshark or tcpdump.
Save the capture file in .pcap or .pcapng format.
Place the capture file in the project directory.

## Example Output
A sample table generated by the script:

Source IP	Destination IP	Protocol	Source Port	Destination Port
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	TCP	25340	8285
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	TCP	8285	25340
192.168.171.1	192.168.171.1	ICMP	-	-
127.0.0.1	127.0.0.1	ICMP	-	-

## Observations from the Example Data:
127.0.0.1 traffic reflects internal communication on the localhost.
ICMP packets (e.g., ping requests) do not include port numbers.
The virtual interface at 192.168.171.1 lacks ports, which is typical for certain configurations.

## Future Enhancements
Support for additional protocols.
Advanced filtering and analysis based on user-defined criteria.
Graphical visualization of traffic patterns.
